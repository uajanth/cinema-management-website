# Cinema Management Website

<sup><sub>Note: The demo may be unpredictably buggy at times, given that it is hosted on platforms using the free-tiers.</sub></sup>

## About
This project is a concept of a cinema management system built for a local chain of Indian theatres. As a frequent movie-goer of the mentioned local chain, I personally didn't enjoy the online experience of purchasing tickets. Additionally, upon looking at ways to improve the experience I found a way to potentially save money for the theatres.

The e-commerce website's frontend is deployed using Vercel, and the backend for this project is deployed using Cyclic.sh.
